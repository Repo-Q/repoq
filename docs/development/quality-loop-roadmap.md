# Meta-Optimizing Quality Loop: Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation strategy for a **monotonic quality guarantee system** - a self-reinforcing quality loop where every commit either improves code quality or is blocked by CI gates.

**Current Status**: Technical foundation ready (64% test coverage, TRS systems validated, VC certificates implemented)  
**Recommended Approach**: MVP-first (Variant 2) for rapid validation, then iterative expansion  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks to working prototype, 2-3 months to production-ready

---

## Core Concept: Guaranteed Quality Monotonicity

### Mathematical Foundation

The system enforces strict monotonicity through:

1. **Hard Constraints** (blocking): Critical metrics must not degrade
   - `tests_ok`: All unit/integration tests must pass
   - `hotspots_ratio`: High-complexity/high-churn files ≤ baseline
   - `todo_count`: New TODO/FIXME/BUG comments forbidden
   - `security_alerts`: No new critical vulnerabilities (SAST/OSV)

2. **Soft Goal** (quality improvement): Integral quality score Q must increase
   ```
   Q = 100 - 20·avg(complexity) - 20·avg(churn) - 30·hotspots_ratio 
       - 7·[¬CI] - 8·[¬ownership_ok] - φ(tests)
   ```

3. **Monotonic Rule**: PR accepted only if:
   - All hard constraints satisfied
   - Q_after ≥ Q_before + ε (ε = 0.1-0.5 noise guard-band)

### Quality Formula Integration

The Q score maps directly to existing RepoQ VC certificates:
```json
{
  "@type": "VerifiableCredential",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "@type": "repo:Project",
    "score": Q,  // ← Integral quality metric
    "complexity": avg_complexity,
    "churn": avg_churn,
    "hotspots": hotspots_ratio
  }
}
```

### ⭐ **Variant 2: MVP with Basic Monotonicity** (2-3 weeks) - RECOMMENDED

**Scope**: Minimum viable product for concept validation

#### Phase 1: Core Gate Implementation (Week 1)

##### 1.1 Basic Gate Command
```python
# New CLI command: repoq gate
@app.command()
def gate(
    base: str = typer.Option(..., help="Base commit SHA or path"),
    head: str = typer.Option(".", help="HEAD path to compare"),
    policy: str = typer.Option(
        ".github/quality-policy.yml", 
        help="Quality policy configuration"
    ),
    output: str = typer.Option(None, help="JSON output for CI")
):
    """
    Compare quality metrics between BASE and HEAD.
    Exit code 0 if quality improved, 2 if degraded.
    """
    base_metrics = analyze_repository(base)
    head_metrics = analyze_repository(head)
    
    result = validate_monotonicity(base_metrics, head_metrics, policy)
    
    if output:
        save_gate_result(result, output)
    
    print_gate_report(result)
    raise typer.Exit(0 if result.passed else 2)
```

##### 1.2 Simple Q Aggregator
```python
def calculate_quality_score(metrics: ProjectMetrics) -> float:
    """Basic Q formula for MVP."""
    avg_complexity = metrics.structure.avg_complexity or 0
    hotspots_ratio = len(metrics.hotspots) / max(len(metrics.files), 1)
    todo_count = len([i for i in metrics.issues if i.type == "TodoComment"])
    
    Q = 100 - 20 * min(avg_complexity / 10, 1.0) \
            - 30 * hotspots_ratio \
            - 10 * min(todo_count / 100, 1.0)
    
    return max(0, min(100, Q))
```

##### 1.3 Basic Hard Constraints
```python
def validate_hard_constraints(base, head, policy) -> List[Violation]:
    violations = []
    
    # Test pass requirement (via pytest exit code)
    if policy.tests_must_pass:
        result = subprocess.run(["pytest"], capture_output=True)
        if result.returncode != 0:
            violations.append(Violation("tests_failed", ...))
    
    # TODO count non-increasing
    if policy.no_new_todos:
        base_todos = count_todos(base)
        head_todos = count_todos(head)
        if head_todos > base_todos:
            violations.append(Violation("new_todos", 
                count=head_todos - base_todos))
    
    # Hotspots ratio non-increasing
    if policy.hotspots_non_increasing:
        if head.hotspots_ratio > base.hotspots_ratio + 0.01:
            violations.append(Violation("hotspots_increased", ...))
    
    return violations
```

#### Phase 2: CI Integration (Week 2)

##### 2.1 Quality Policy Configuration
```yaml
# .github/quality-policy.yml
version: "1.0"

hard_constraints:
  tests_must_pass: true
  no_new_todos: true
  hotspots_non_increasing: true
  max_complexity_increase: 5  # points

soft_goal:
  epsilon: 0.2  # Minimum Q improvement
  aggregator: "basic"  # basic|advanced|zag

budgets:
  waiver_tokens_per_sprint: 1
  waiver_requires_approval: true

reporting:
  comment_on_pr: true
  upload_artifacts: true
```

##### 2.2 GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality-gate.yml
name: Quality Gate
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Need history for base comparison
      
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      
      - name: Install RepoQ
        run: pip install -e ".[full]"
      
      - name: Checkout BASE
        run: |
          git checkout ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          mkdir -p /tmp/base
          repoq full . -o /tmp/base/quality.jsonld
      
      - name: Checkout HEAD
        run: |
          git checkout ${{ github.sha }}
          repoq full . -o /tmp/head/quality.jsonld
      
      - name: Run Quality Gate
        run: |
          repoq gate \
            --base /tmp/base/quality.jsonld \
            --head /tmp/head/quality.jsonld \
            --policy .github/quality-policy.yml \
            --output gate-result.json
      
      - name: Upload Results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: quality-gate-results
          path: gate-result.json
```

#### Phase 3: Local Developer Experience (Week 3)

##### 3.1 Pre-push Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push
echo "🔍 Running quick quality check..."

repoq structure . -o /tmp/quick-check.jsonld --quiet

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Quality check failed. Push blocked."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Local quality check passed"
```

##### 3.2 Developer Documentation
```markdown
# docs/development/quality-gate-guide.md
- How to interpret gate failures
- Using --policy-dry-run for local testing
- Requesting waiver tokens
- Understanding Q score breakdown
```

#### MVP Success Criteria

- ✅ Working `repoq gate` command with exit codes
- ✅ Basic Q formula in VC certificates

- ✅ Developer can test locally before push

#### MVP Timeline
| Week | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| Week 1 | Core gate command + Q aggregator |
| Week 2 | CI integration + policy config |
| Week 3 | Local hooks + documentation |

#### Benefits
- ✅ Fast time to market (2-3 weeks)

---

### 🔬 **Variant 3: Research Prototype** (1 week)

**Scope**: Mathematical validation only, no production integration

#### Purpose
- Validate Q formula calibration
- Test noise tolerance (ε tuning)
- Experiment with weight optimization

#### Not Included
- CI integration
- Policy system
- Hard constraints

#### Use Case
Academic validation before committing to implementation

---

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

#### 1. Performance Impact
**Risk**: Double analysis (BASE + HEAD) = 2x CI time

**Impact**: High for large repositories (>10k files)

**Mitigation**:
- Implement incremental analysis (Phase 2+)
- Cache baseline analysis results
- Parallelize analyzer execution
- Use `structure` mode for fast pre-push checks

#### 2. Metric Noise
**Risk**: Small code changes cause Q fluctuations larger than ε

**Impact**: False negatives block legitimate PRs

**Mitigation**:
- Adaptive ε based on change size
- Statistical smoothing (rolling average)
- Whitelist for known-noisy files (tests, generated code)

#### 3. Gaming Susceptibility
**Risk**: Developers optimize Q without real quality improvement

**Impact**: Q increases but actual quality degrades

**Mitigation** (Post-MVP):
- ZAG PCQ min-aggregator (forces worst module improvement)
- Manual audit samples (10% of PRs)
- Correlation analysis Q vs bugs/incidents

### Process Risks

#### 1. Developer Friction
**Risk**: Quality gate blocks urgent hotfixes

**Impact**: Reduced development velocity, workarounds

**Mitigation**:
- Clear waiver process (1-2 tokens/sprint)
- Fast local feedback (<30s)
- Educational documentation

#### 2. False Positives
**Risk**: Legitimate code changes fail gate incorrectly

**Impact**: Developer frustration, loss of trust

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive test suite for gate logic
- Dry-run mode for testing policies
- Quick appeal process

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Ready Components (from existing codebase)

```python
# Already implemented:
✓ VC certificates generation (certs/generator.py, quality.py)
✓ JSON-LD/RDF export infrastructure
✓ SHACL validation shapes
✓ Basic GitHub Actions workflow
✓ ZAG integration scaffolding (integrations/zag.py)
✓ TRS mathematical soundness (5/7 violations fixed)
```

### ⚠️ Missing for MVP

```python
# Need to implement:
☐ Incremental analysis (BASE vs HEAD comparison)
☐ repoq gate CLI command
☐ Quality policy YAML parser
☐ Hard constraint validators
☐ TODO/FIXME detector
☐ Gate result reporting
```

### 🔴 Blockers for Production

```python
# Critical gaps:
✗ Test coverage 64% (need 80%+)
✗ No pytest integration
✗ No security scanning (SAST/OSV)
✗ Performance not optimized for CI
✗ No waiver token system
```

## Decision: MVP Prioritization

### Why Variant 2 (MVP) is Recommended

1. **Rapid Validation**: 2-3 weeks to working system vs 8-12 weeks for full implementation
2. **Low Risk**: Evolutionary approach, doesn't destabilize current codebase
3. **Immediate Value**: Developers get quality feedback in CI immediately
4. **Proof of Concept**: Validates monotonicity concept with real usage data
5. **Foundation for Growth**: Clean architecture allows Phase 2/3 additions

### Implementation Order

**Priority P0** (MVP - Week 1-3):
- [x] TRS mathematical soundness
- [ ] `repoq gate` command implementation
- [ ] Basic Q aggregator in VC certificates
- [ ] Simple hard constraints (tests, TODO, hotspots)
- [ ] GitHub Actions quality-gate.yml
- [ ] Quality policy YAML support

**Priority P1** (Production Hardening - Week 4-8):
- [ ] ZAG PCQ integration for gaming protection
- [ ] Statistical noise filtering (adaptive ε)
- [ ] Waiver token system
- [ ] Performance optimization (caching, incremental analysis)
- [ ] Comment bot with ΔQ breakdown

**Priority P2** (Advanced Features - Week 8-12):
- [ ] PCE k-repair witnesses in PR comments
- [ ] Organizational dashboard (multi-repo tracking)
- [ ] Weight adaptation via contextual bandits

## Success Metrics

### MVP Phase (T+3 weeks)
- ✅ Quality gate blocks ≥80% of quality-degrading PRs
- ✅ False positive rate <5%
- ✅ CI overhead <2 minutes per PR
- ✅ Developer satisfaction score ≥4/5

### Production Phase (T+12 weeks)
- ✅ Zero quality regressions merged to main
- ✅ Average Q score improves 10+ points over 3 months
- ✅ Gaming attempts detected and prevented (via ZAG PCQ)
- ✅ 90% of waivers are legitimate emergency cases

---

## Conclusion

The meta-optimizing quality loop is **architecturally sound** and **technically feasible** with RepoQ's existing infrastructure. The **MVP approach (Variant 2)** provides the fastest path to validation while minimizing risk.

**Recommendation**: Begin MVP implementation immediately with 2-3 week timeline. Success here validates the concept and provides foundation for advanced features in subsequent phases.

**Key Success Factor**: Maintain focus on core monotonicity guarantee in MVP, defer advanced features (ZAG gaming protection, weight adaptation) to Phase 2.
