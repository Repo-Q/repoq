# Meta-Optimizing Quality Loop: Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation strategy for a **monotonic quality guarantee system** - a self-reinforcing quality loop where every commit either improves code quality or is blocked by CI gates.

**Current Status**: Technical foundation ready (64% test coverage, TRS systems validated, VC certificates implemented, 77 artifacts in tmp/ ready for integration)  
**Methodology**: Value-Driven Analysis and Design (VDAD) integrated with agile architectural practices  
**Recommended Approach**: MVP-first for rapid validation, then iterative expansion following VDAD 7-step process  
**Timeline**: Structured as iterative phases without fixed dates (see VDAD Integration section)

> üìã **New**: This roadmap now integrates the VDAD (Value-Driven Analysis and Design) methodology for systematic stakeholder-centric development. See [VDAD Integration](#vdad-integration-roadmap) section below for the comprehensive 6-month strategic plan.

## Core Concept: Guaranteed Quality Monotonicity

### Mathematical Foundation

The system enforces strict monotonicity through:

1. **Hard Constraints** (blocking): Critical metrics must not degrade
   - `tests_ok`: All unit/integration tests must pass
   - `hotspots_ratio`: High-complexity/high-churn files ‚â§ baseline
   - `todo_count`: New TODO/FIXME/BUG comments forbidden
   - `security_alerts`: No new critical vulnerabilities (SAST/OSV)

2. **Soft Goal** (quality improvement): Integral quality score Q must increase
   ```
   Q = 100 - 20¬∑avg(complexity) - 20¬∑avg(churn) - 30¬∑hotspots_ratio 
       - 7¬∑[¬¨CI] - 8¬∑[¬¨ownership_ok] - œÜ(tests)
   ```

3. **Monotonic Rule**: PR accepted only if:
   - All hard constraints satisfied
   - Q_after ‚â• Q_before + Œµ (Œµ = 0.1-0.5 noise guard-band)

### Quality Formula Integration

The Q score maps directly to existing RepoQ VC certificates:
```json
{
  "@type": "VerifiableCredential",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "@type": "repo:Project",
    "score": Q,  // ‚Üê Integral quality metric
    "complexity": avg_complexity,
    "churn": avg_churn,
    "hotspots": hotspots_ratio
  }
}
```

### ‚≠ê **Variant 2: MVP with Basic Monotonicity** (2-3 weeks) - RECOMMENDED

**Scope**: Minimum viable product for concept validation

#### Phase 1: Core Gate Implementation (Week 1)

##### 1.1 Basic Gate Command
```python
# New CLI command: repoq gate
@app.command()
def gate(
    base: str = typer.Option(..., help="Base commit SHA or path"),
    head: str = typer.Option(".", help="HEAD path to compare"),
    policy: str = typer.Option(
        ".github/quality-policy.yml", 
        help="Quality policy configuration"
    ),
    output: str = typer.Option(None, help="JSON output for CI")
):
    """
    Compare quality metrics between BASE and HEAD.
    Exit code 0 if quality improved, 2 if degraded.
    """
    base_metrics = analyze_repository(base)
    head_metrics = analyze_repository(head)
    
    result = validate_monotonicity(base_metrics, head_metrics, policy)
    
    if output:
        save_gate_result(result, output)
    
    print_gate_report(result)
    raise typer.Exit(0 if result.passed else 2)
```

##### 1.2 Simple Q Aggregator
```python
def calculate_quality_score(metrics: ProjectMetrics) -> float:
    """Basic Q formula for MVP."""
    avg_complexity = metrics.structure.avg_complexity or 0
    hotspots_ratio = len(metrics.hotspots) / max(len(metrics.files), 1)
    todo_count = len([i for i in metrics.issues if i.type == "TodoComment"])
    
    Q = 100 - 20 * min(avg_complexity / 10, 1.0) \
            - 30 * hotspots_ratio \
            - 10 * min(todo_count / 100, 1.0)
    
    return max(0, min(100, Q))
```

##### 1.3 Basic Hard Constraints
```python
def validate_hard_constraints(base, head, policy) -> List[Violation]:
    violations = []
    
    # Test pass requirement (via pytest exit code)
    if policy.tests_must_pass:
        result = subprocess.run(["pytest"], capture_output=True)
        if result.returncode != 0:
            violations.append(Violation("tests_failed", ...))
    
    # TODO count non-increasing
    if policy.no_new_todos:
        base_todos = count_todos(base)
        head_todos = count_todos(head)
        if head_todos > base_todos:
            violations.append(Violation("new_todos", 
                count=head_todos - base_todos))
    
    # Hotspots ratio non-increasing
    if policy.hotspots_non_increasing:
        if head.hotspots_ratio > base.hotspots_ratio + 0.01:
            violations.append(Violation("hotspots_increased", ...))
    
    return violations
```

#### Phase 2: CI Integration (Week 2)

#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push
echo "üîç Running quick quality check..."

repoq structure . -o /tmp/quick-check.jsonld --quiet

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Quality check failed. Push blocked."
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Local quality check passed"
```

##### 3.2 Developer Documentation
```markdown
# docs/development/quality-gate-guide.md

- ‚úÖ Working `repoq gate` command with exit codes
- ‚úÖ Basic Q formula in VC certificates
- ‚úÖ Simple hard constraints (tests, TODO, hotspots)
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions integration
- ‚úÖ Developer can test locally before push

#### MVP Timeline
| Week | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| Week 1 | Core gate command + Q aggregator |
| Week 2 | CI integration + policy config |
| Week 3 | Local hooks + documentation |

#### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Fast time to market (2-3 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Validates concept with real usage
- ‚úÖ Low risk, evolutionary approach
- ‚úÖ Immediate value for developers

#### Risks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited gaming protection (no ZAG PCQ yet)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic noise handling (fixed Œµ)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No organizational dashboard

---

### üî¨ **Variant 3: Research Prototype** (1 week)

**Scope**: Mathematical validation only, no production integration

#### Purpose
- Validate Q formula calibration
- Test noise tolerance (Œµ tuning)
- Experiment with weight optimization

#### Not Included
- CI integration
- Policy system
- Hard constraints

#### Use Case
Academic validation before committing to implementation

---

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

#### 1. Performance Impact
**Risk**: Double analysis (BASE + HEAD) = 2x CI time

**Impact**: High for large repositories (>10k files)

**Mitigation**:
- Implement incremental analysis (Phase 2+)
- Cache baseline analysis results
- Parallelize analyzer execution
- Use `structure` mode for fast pre-push checks

#### 2. Metric Noise
**Risk**: Small code changes cause Q fluctuations larger than Œµ

**Impact**: False negatives block legitimate PRs

**Mitigation**:
- Adaptive Œµ based on change size
- Statistical smoothing (rolling average)
- Whitelist for known-noisy files (tests, generated code)

#### 3. Gaming Susceptibility
**Risk**: Developers optimize Q without real quality improvement

**Impact**: Q increases but actual quality degrades

**Mitigation** (Post-MVP):
- ZAG PCQ min-aggregator (forces worst module improvement)
- Manual audit samples (10% of PRs)
- Correlation analysis Q vs bugs/incidents

### Process Risks

#### 1. Developer Friction
**Risk**: Quality gate blocks urgent hotfixes

**Impact**: Reduced development velocity, workarounds

**Mitigation**:
- Clear waiver process (1-2 tokens/sprint)
- Fast local feedback (<30s)
- Educational documentation

#### 2. False Positives
**Risk**: Legitimate code changes fail gate incorrectly

**Impact**: Developer frustration, loss of trust

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive test suite for gate logic
- Dry-run mode for testing policies
- Quick appeal process

```

### üî¥ Blockers for Production

```python
# Critical gaps:
‚úó Test coverage 64% (need 80%+)
‚úó No pytest integration
‚úó No security scanning (SAST/OSV)
‚úó Performance not optimized for CI
‚úó No waiver token system
```

---

## Conclusion

The meta-optimizing quality loop is **architecturally sound** and **technically feasible** with RepoQ's existing infrastructure. The **MVP approach (Variant 2)** provides the fastest path to validation while minimizing risk.

**Recommendation**: Begin implementation following the integrated VDAD roadmap (see next section). Start with Phase 1 (Domain Immersion) while executing MVP deliverables, ensuring value-driven decisions at every step.

**Key Success Factor**: Maintain focus on core monotonicity guarantee in MVP, while systematically building stakeholder value alignment through VDAD process. Advanced features (ZAG gaming protection, weight adaptation, AI agents) emerge naturally from stakeholder value prioritization in Phases 2-3.

---

## VDAD Integration Roadmap

**Methodology**: Value-Driven Analysis and Design (VDAD) ‚Äî a 7-step process for integrating human/ethical values into the development lifecycle ([ethical-se.github.io](https://ethical-se.github.io)).

**Key Principles**:
- **Stakeholder-centric**: All decisions traced back to stakeholder values
- **Iterative**: Each 6-month cycle refines domain understanding
- **AI-assisted**: LLM copilot supports analysis, design, and documentation
- **Formal foundations**: VDAD complements (not replaces) mathematical rigor from `formal-foundations-complete.md`

**Integration with RepoQ**: This VDAD roadmap runs in parallel with the tactical MVP/Production phases above, providing strategic direction and value validation.

---

### Phase 1: Domain Immersion & Stakeholder Mapping

**VDAD Steps**: Step 1 (Domain Analysis), Step 2 (Stakeholder Identification)

**Objective**: Gain deep understanding of RepoQ's domain and identify all stakeholders.

#### Tasks

**1.1 Domain Analysis**
- [ ] Study formal documentation (`formal-foundations-complete.md`, 14 theorems, 6 guarantees)
- [ ] Review tmp/ artifacts (77 files: meta-loop, ZAG, Any2Math integrations)
- [ ] Analyze existing codebase (64% coverage, TRS systems, VC certificates)
- [ ] Map domain concepts using Domain-Driven Design:
  - Core domain: Quality metrics (Q, PCQ, complexity, hotspots)
  - Supporting domains: TRS normalization, ontologies, VC certificates
  - Generic domains: Git integration, CLI, reporting
- **AI Copilot Role**: Summarize large documents, generate domain glossary, propose initial bounded contexts

**1.2 Context Modeling**
- [ ] Build Context Map showing system boundaries and relationships
- [ ] Create domain entity diagram (Project, File, Metric, Certificate, etc.)
- [ ] Define ubiquitous language for RepoQ (terms like "admission policy", "PCQ", "stratification")
- [ ] Document bounded contexts:
  - Analysis Context: Code parsing, metric calculation
  - Quality Context: Q scoring, gate decisions, PCQ/PCE
  - Ontology Context: Code/C4/DDD ontologies, semantic inference
  - Integration Context: CI/CD, GitHub Actions, CLI
- **AI Copilot Role**: Generate draft Context Map, suggest entity relationships, validate terminology consistency

**1.3 Stakeholder Mapping**
- [ ] Identify stakeholder groups:
  - **Developers**: Primary users of quality gates
  - **Team Leads/Managers**: Track quality trends, allocate improvement effort
  - **DevOps Engineers**: Integrate into CI/CD pipelines
  - **Open Source Community**: Contributors, adopters
  - **Researchers**: Formal methods, software engineering academics
  - **Ourselves**: Project maintainers
- [ ] Create stakeholder map with roles, responsibilities, and touchpoints
- [ ] For each group, document:
  - Goals (e.g., developers: fast feedback, managers: quality visibility)
  - Pain points (e.g., developers: cryptic error messages, managers: gaming metrics)
  - Expectations (e.g., DevOps: <2min CI overhead)
- **AI Copilot Role**: Generate stakeholder personas, cross-check stakeholder list with similar projects, suggest missing groups

**Deliverables**:
- Domain model document (bounded contexts, entities, ubiquitous language)
- Context Map diagram (Mermaid or C4 model)
- Stakeholder map with personas/roles (table or visual map)

---

### Phase 2: Value Elicitation & Prioritization

**VDAD Steps**: Step 3 (Value Identification), Step 4 (Value Prioritization)

**Objective**: Identify what each stakeholder group values and prioritize these values.

#### Tasks

**2.1 Value Identification**
- [ ] For each stakeholder group, elicit core values:
  - **Developers**: Fast feedback, actionable insights, transparency, fairness (no arbitrary blocks)
  - **Managers**: Quality visibility, gaming protection, team accountability
  - **DevOps**: Reliability, low maintenance, integration simplicity
  - **Community**: Openness, reproducibility, scientific rigor
  - **Researchers**: Formal correctness, innovation (proof-carrying certificates, TRS)
- [ ] Conduct value mapping workshop (with AI copilot as facilitator):
  - Use Stakeholder Value Map template ([ethical-se.github.io](https://ethical-se.github.io))
  - For each value, document:
    - **Value name**: e.g., "Transparency"
    - **Description**: "System explains why PR was blocked"
    - **Stakeholders**: Developers (high), Managers (medium)
    - **Examples**: Gate output shows ŒîQ breakdown, PCE witness for improvement
- [ ] Create Value Register (spreadsheet or database) tracking all values
- **AI Copilot Role**: Extract values from existing documentation/issues, propose typical values for QA tools, structure Value Register

**2.2 Value Impact Mapping**
- [ ] Map each system feature/function to values it supports:
  - `repoq gate` ‚Üí Values: Monotonicity, Transparency, Fast feedback
  - PCQ/PCE (ZAG) ‚Üí Values: Gaming protection, Fairness, Accountability
  - Any2Math normalization ‚Üí Values: Reproducibility, Correctness, Scientific rigor
  - Ontological intelligence ‚Üí Values: Actionability, Insight depth
  - VC certificates ‚Üí Values: Auditability, Trust, Traceability
- [ ] Identify value gaps: areas where stakeholder values are not addressed
- [ ] Create Value Impact Map diagram showing feature‚Üîvalue connections
- **AI Copilot Role**: Auto-generate impact map from Value Register + feature list, highlight gaps, suggest new features for unmet values

**2.3 Value Prioritization**
- [ ] Define prioritization criteria:
  - **Stakeholder count**: How many groups care?
  - **Strategic alignment**: Does it support RepoQ's mission (formal quality assurance)?
  - **Impact**: High/medium/low effect on project success?
  - **Risk**: Does neglecting this value create ethical/legal issues?
- [ ] Score each value on criteria (e.g., 1-5 scale)
- [ ] Produce prioritized value list (Tier 1: critical, Tier 2: important, Tier 3: nice-to-have)
- [ ] Document rationale for each priority decision
- **AI Copilot Role**: Apply scoring rubric automatically, generate priority matrix, validate consistency of rankings

**Deliverables**:
- Value Register (comprehensive list with descriptions, stakeholders, priority)
- Value Impact Map (feature ‚Üî value connections)
- Prioritized value list with justifications

---

### Phase 3: Strategic Decisions & Requirements

**VDAD Steps**: Step 5 (Digitalization Decision), Step 6 (Requirements Elaboration)

**Objective**: Translate prioritized values into strategic decisions and concrete requirements.

#### Tasks

**3.1 Strategic Decisions (Digitalization Decision)**
- [ ] For each Tier 1 value, decide how to address it:
  - **Transparency** ‚Üí Add detailed gate output with ŒîQ breakdown, PCE witness
  - **Gaming protection** ‚Üí Integrate ZAG PCQ (already in tmp/zag_repoq-finished/)
  - **Correctness** ‚Üí Use Any2Math for deterministic normalization (tmp/repoq-any2math-integration/)
  - **Scientific rigor** ‚Üí Publish formal proofs (formal-foundations-complete.md)
  - **Fast feedback** ‚Üí Optimize analysis time, incremental processing
- [ ] Document strategic rationale for each decision:
  - **Context**: Why is this value important now?
  - **Decision**: What specific action/feature addresses it?
  - **Alternatives considered**: What other options were rejected and why?
- [ ] Record decisions in Strategic Decision Log (similar to ADR format)
- **AI Copilot Role**: Propose decision options, analyze trade-offs, draft decision records

**3.2 Ethical Requirements (IEEE 7000 EVR)**
- [ ] Formulate Ethical Value Requirements (EVR) for key values:
  - **Transparency EVR**: "System SHALL provide human-readable explanation for every gate rejection, including specific metrics that failed and recommended fixes"
  - **Fairness EVR**: "System SHALL NOT penalize developers for legitimate code complexity (e.g., implementing algorithms); complex code allowed if justified and well-tested"
  - **Gaming protection EVR**: "System SHALL detect and block attempts to artificially inflate Q score (e.g., via PCQ min-aggregator: all modules must meet threshold, not just average)"
  - **Privacy EVR**: "System SHALL NOT transmit repository contents to external services without explicit consent (all analysis local or self-hosted)"
- [ ] Link each EVR to one or more values in Value Register
- [ ] Ensure EVRs are verifiable (with acceptance criteria)
- **AI Copilot Role**: Generate EVR templates, check IEEE 7000 compliance, suggest verification methods

**3.3 Functional & Non-Functional Requirements**
- [ ] Update functional requirements based on strategic decisions:
  - FR1: `repoq gate` command with exit codes (0=pass, 1=fail)
  - FR2: Q metric calculation with configurable weights (.github/quality-policy.yml)
  - FR3: Hard constraints validation (tests, TODO, hotspots)
  - FR4: PCQ min-aggregator integration (ZAG)
  - FR5: PCE k-repair witness generation
  - FR6: Ontological intelligence (Code/C4/DDD pattern detection)
  - FR7: Self-application safety (stratification levels 0-2)
  - FR8: Any2Math normalization for deterministic metrics
  - ...
- [ ] Define NFRs (SMART criteria):
  - **Performance**: Analysis time ‚â§2 minutes for repos <1000 files, ‚â§5 minutes for <10000 files
  - **Reliability**: Gate false positive rate <5%, false negative rate <1%
  - **Usability**: Developer can understand gate failure in <30 seconds
  - **Security**: No credentials leaked in logs, no external data transmission
  - **Maintainability**: Code coverage ‚â•80%, documentation coverage 100%
  - **Compatibility**: Works with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, local git hooks
- [ ] Validate requirements against Value Register (each requirement supports ‚â•1 value)
- **AI Copilot Role**: Generate SMART-formatted NFRs, cross-check requirements vs values, identify missing requirements

**Deliverables**:
- Strategic Decision Log (why we're building what)
- Ethical Value Requirements (EVR) document
- Updated Requirements Specification (FR + NFR)

---

### Phase 4: Architecture Design & Decision Recording

**VDAD Steps**: Step 7 (Architecture Design)

**Objective**: Design system architecture satisfying all requirements, with full traceability to values.

#### Tasks

**4.1 High-Level Architecture Design**
- [ ] Design component architecture using existing formal foundations:
  - **Core Engine**: Metric calculation, TRS normalization, Q scoring
  - **Gate Logic**: Admission policy evaluation, hard constraints
  - **Ontology Intelligence**: Code/C4/DDD analyzers, semantic inference (tmp/repoq-meta-loop-addons/)
  - **ZAG Integration**: PCQ/PCE module (tmp/zag_repoq-finished/)
  - **Any2Math Bridge**: Lean normalization adapter (tmp/repoq-any2math-integration/)
  - **Certificate Generator**: VC credential creation with proof-carrying evidence
  - **CLI**: Command-line interface (`gate`, `meta-self`, `any2math-normalize`)
  - **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI runners
  - **Knowledge Base**: RDF store for ontologies, SPARQL endpoint
- [ ] Apply DDD tactical patterns:
  - Bounded contexts: Analysis, Quality, Ontology, Integration
  - Aggregates: Project (root), File, Metric, Certificate
  - Services: AnalysisService, GateService, OntologyService
  - Repositories: ProjectRepository (git abstraction)
- [ ] Create architecture diagram (C4 model recommended):
  - Context diagram: RepoQ system + external systems (Git, CI, LLM)
  - Container diagram: Major components and data flows
  - Component diagram (for complex containers): Internal modules
- **AI Copilot Role**: Generate draft C4 diagrams from component list, suggest DDD patterns, validate architectural consistency

**4.2 NFR Realization**
- [ ] For each NFR, design architectural mechanism:
  - **Performance NFR** ‚Üí Caching layer (metrics, normalized artifacts), incremental analysis
  - **Reliability NFR** ‚Üí Statistical noise filtering (Œµ-guard), test suite (80%+ coverage)
  - **Usability NFR** ‚Üí Structured error messages, PCE witness in output
  - **Security NFR** ‚Üí Read-only file access, no network calls (except opt-in LLM)
  - **Maintainability NFR** ‚Üí Modular architecture, ADR log, comprehensive docs
- [ ] Document architectural tactics in architecture document (arc42 template)
- **AI Copilot Role**: Propose architectural tactics from patterns catalog, validate NFR coverage

**4.3 Architecture Decision Records (ADR)**
- [ ] Establish ADR log in `docs/architecture/decisions/`
- [ ] Create ADR for every significant decision:
  - **ADR-001**: Use BAML for AI agent (type-safe LLM outputs)
  - **ADR-002**: Choose RDFLib + Oxigraph for RDF storage (Python-native, standards-compliant)
  - **ADR-003**: Integrate Any2Math via subprocess (isolate Lean runtime)
  - **ADR-004**: Adopt arc42 for architecture documentation (comprehensive, proven)
  - **ADR-005**: Use Mermaid for diagrams (text-based, git-friendly, MkDocs-compatible)
  - **ADR-006**: Stratification levels 0-2 for self-analysis (prevents paradoxes per Theorem F)
  - **ADR-007**: PCQ min-aggregator for gaming protection (ZAG framework, Theorem C)
  - ...
- [ ] Use lightweight ADR format (MADR or Y-statements):
  ```markdown
  # ADR-001: Use BAML for AI Agent
  
  **Context**: Need type-safe, reliable AI agent for semantic analysis.
  
  **Decision**: Adopt BoundaryML BAML framework.
  
  **Rationale**: BAML provides DSL for LLM functions with compile-time type checking,
  reducing hallucination risk and improving testability.
  
  **Consequences**: +Type safety, +Testability, -Learning curve, -Vendor lock-in (mitigated by open-source)
  ```
- **AI Copilot Role**: Generate ADR drafts from verbal explanations, auto-fill ADR template, maintain ADR index

**4.4 AI Agent Design (BAML Integration)**
- [ ] Define AI agent responsibilities:
  - **Semantic Code Analysis**: Understand PR context beyond syntax (intent, patterns)
  - **Explanation Generation**: Translate gate failures into human-readable advice
  - **Improvement Suggestions**: Propose specific code changes (PCE witness augmentation)
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual patterns (potential gaming, security issues)
- [ ] Design BAML functions for each responsibility:
  ```baml
  function AnalyzePRContext(diff: string, metrics: Metrics) -> PRContext {
    client GPT4
    prompt #"
      Analyze this git diff and metrics:
      
      Diff: {{ diff }}
      Metrics: {{ metrics }}
      
      Extract:
      - Intent: What is the developer trying to accomplish?
      - Patterns: What design patterns are used?
      - Risks: What could go wrong?
    "#
  }
  ```
- [ ] Specify agent boundaries (security, resource limits):
  - Read-only access to repository
  - Max 10 LLM calls per analysis (cost control)
  - Timeout: 30 seconds per function
  - No external network except LLM API
- [ ] Plan phased rollout:
  - **Phase 1**: Experimental mode (agent provides suggestions, no gate impact)
  - **Phase 2**: Advisory mode (agent suggestions shown in PR comments)
  - **Phase 3**: Active mode (agent detects gaming, can influence gate decision)
- **AI Copilot Role**: Generate BAML function stubs, validate function signatures, suggest safety constraints

**Deliverables**:
- Architecture document (arc42 format recommended)
- C4 diagrams (context, container, component)
- ADR log (comprehensive decision record)
- BAML agent specification (functions, boundaries, rollout plan)

## Integration of VDAD with Existing Roadmap

**How VDAD phases align with MVP/Production timeline**:

| MVP/Production Phase | VDAD Phases | Key Integration Points |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Pre-MVP: Planning** | Phase 1-2 | Domain analysis informs feature prioritization; stakeholder values drive MVP scope |
| **MVP: Week 1-3** | Phase 3 | Requirements from Value Register ‚Üí gate logic implementation |
| **Production: Week 4-8** | Phase 4 | Architecture design ‚Üí ZAG/Any2Math integration decisions recorded in ADR |
| **Advanced: Week 8-12** | Phase 5 | AI agent deployment, ontological intelligence, comprehensive testing against values |
| **Post-Launch** | Iteration Planning | Retrospective feeds into next VDAD cycle (re-run Steps 1-7 with updated context) |

**Key Principle**: VDAD provides **strategic direction** (what to build and why), while MVP/Production phases provide **tactical execution** (how to build and when). Both run in parallel, informing each other.
