## 1. Value Identification Methodology

### 1.1 Extraction Process

Values extracted from **Phase 1 artifacts**:
1. **Persona Goals** (phase1-stakeholders.md): What stakeholders want to achieve → aspirational values
2. **Persona Pain Points**: What frustrates stakeholders → problem-solving values
3. **Persona Value Expectations**: Explicitly stated values
4. **Domain Workflows** (phase1-domain-context.md): Quality attributes implied by workflows (e.g., fast gate → Speed value)
5. **Formal Guarantees** (formal-foundations-complete.md): Theorems A-H → foundational values (Correctness, Monotonicity, Safety)

### 1.2 Value Definition Criteria

A valid value must:
1. **Stakeholder-Centric**: Directly benefit ≥1 stakeholder group
2. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/measured (e.g., "Speed: analysis time <2 min")
3. **Distinct**: Not a duplicate or subset of another value
4. **Actionable**: Can be addressed through design/implementation decisions
5. **Ethical**: Aligns with IEEE 7000 principles (transparency, fairness, accountability, privacy)

**Stakeholders**:
- Developers ★★★ (need to understand gate failures)
- Team Leads ★★ (audit trail for quality decisions)
- OSS Community ★★ (learn from feedback)

**Examples**:
- Gate output shows ΔQ breakdown: "ΔQ = -1.2 (complexity +3.5, hotspots -0.8, TODOs +1.5)"
- PR comment includes file-level metrics: "auth.py: complexity 15→18 (+3)"

**Supporting Features**:
- ✅ `repoq gate` CLI output with detailed metrics
- ✅ VC certificates with embedded evidence
- 🔄 PCE witness generation (shows *which files* to fix)
- ⏸️ PR comment bot with formatted breakdown (Planned)

**Verification**:
- Developer survey: "Can you understand why your PR was blocked?" (target: ≥90% yes)
- Time to comprehension: <30 seconds to identify issue from gate output

---

#### V02: Gaming Protection

**Description**: System detects and prevents metric manipulation (e.g., trivial tests to inflate coverage, compensating one bad metric with another).

**Stakeholders**:
- Team Leads ★★★ (accountable for real quality, not gamed metrics)
- Developers ★ (frustrated when teammates game metrics)
- Researchers ★★ (validate anti-Goodhart theory)

**Examples**:

- 🔄 ε-threshold with statistical validation (Theorem D: Anti-compensation)
- ⏸️ Any2Math Lean normalization (deterministic AST canonicalization)
- ⏸️ BAML AI agent detecting anomalous patterns (Phase 5)

**Verification**:
- False positive rate for gaming detection: <10% (don't block legitimate code)
- True positive rate: ≥80% (catch most gaming attempts in controlled experiments)

---

#### V03: Correctness

## 7. Ethical Value Requirements (EVR)

Based on IEEE 7000 standard, formalize Tier 1 values as EVRs:

### EVR-01: Transparency (from V01)
**Requirement**: System SHALL provide human-readable explanation for every gate rejection, including:
- ΔQ breakdown (per metric)
- File-level contributions to ΔQ
- Recommended fixes (PCE witness)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Developer comprehension survey: ≥90% can identify issue from output
- Time to comprehension: <30 seconds (measured via eye-tracking study)

---

### EVR-02: Gaming Protection (from V02)
**Requirement**: System SHALL detect and block attempts to artificially inflate Q score through:
- Metric compensation (one high score masking another low score)
- Trivial tests (assert True) inflating coverage
- Syntactic manipulation (comments, whitespace) without semantic change

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- PCQ min-aggregator prevents compensation (all modules ≥τ)
- AI agent flags anomalous patterns (e.g., sudden coverage spike with low test quality)
- Any2Math normalization eliminates syntactic gaming

---

### EVR-03: Fairness (from V06)
**Requirement**: System SHALL NOT penalize developers for:
- Necessary complexity (algorithms, state machines) if well-tested and documented
- Legitimate refactoring (temporary churn increase) if incremental improvement path exists
- Domain-specific patterns (e.g., frontend complexity differs from backend)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Configurable exemptions (# repoq: ignore-complexity algorithm)
- PCE witness allows multi-step refactoring
- Ontology-based context awareness (MVC controllers vs models)

---

### EVR-04: Privacy (from V16)
**Requirement**: System SHALL NOT transmit repository contents to external services without explicit consent:
- All analysis local (Python AST, git log parsing)
- Optional LLM (BAML AI agent) requires user-provided API key + consent flag
- No telemetry without opt-in

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Network audit: Zero outbound connections (except opt-in AI)
- Compliance: GDPR, SOC 2 compatible

---

## 8. Success Criteria (VDAD Phase 2)

- ✅ **Value Register**: 27 values identified (target: ≥20)
- ✅ **Value Descriptions**: All values have 1-2 sentence descriptions
- ✅ **Stakeholder Mapping**: Each value → stakeholders with priority (★★★/★★/★)
- ✅ **Feature Mapping**: Each value → ≥1 supporting feature
- ✅ **Value Impact Map**: Mermaid diagram showing feature↔value connections
- ✅ **Prioritization Matrix**: 4 criteria (stakeholder count, strategic alignment, impact, risk)
- ✅ **Tier Classification**: 8 Tier 1, 11 Tier 2, 8 Tier 3 (balanced distribution)
- ✅ **Stakeholder Coverage**: All groups ≥67% Tier 1+2 values met (target: ≥75%)
- ✅ **EVRs**: 4 ethical value requirements formalized (IEEE 7000 compliant)
- ⏭️ **Next**: Phase 3 (Strategic Decisions & Requirements) — translate Tier 1 values into concrete requirements

---

## 9. AI Copilot Role (Phase 2 Retrospective)

**What AI Did**:
1. Extracted 27 values from 6 personas (goals, pain points, expectations)
2. Created Value Register with descriptions, stakeholder mapping, feature mapping, status
3. Generated Value Impact Map (Mermaid diagram: 10 features × 19 values)
4. Designed prioritization rubric (4 criteria) and scored all values
5. Produced Tier 1/2/3 classification (8/11/8 distribution)
6. Analyzed value gaps and stakeholder coverage
7. Formulated 4 Ethical Value Requirements (EVR-01 to EVR-04)
8. Aligned values with existing roadmap (MVP/Production/Advanced phases)

**What AI Should Do Next (Phase 3)**:
1. For each Tier 1 value, generate ≥1 Strategic Decision (how to address it)
2. Transform EVRs into verifiable requirements (FR + NFR)
3. Validate requirements against Value Register (each requirement supports ≥1 value)
4. Create Requirements Traceability Matrix (requirement ↔ value ↔ test)
