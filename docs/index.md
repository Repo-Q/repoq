## ‚ö° Quick Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Full quality analysis
repoq full ./my-project --format json

# Structure analysis only  
repoq structure ./my-project --md report.md

repoq history ./my-project --since "2024-01-01"
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality.yml
- name: Quality Analysis
  run: |
    repoq full . --format json > quality.json
    repoq structure . --format markdown > QUALITY_REPORT.md
```

### Semantic Web Export
```bash
# Export as RDF/Turtle for knowledge graphs
repoq full ./my-project --format turtle > quality.ttl

# JSON-LD for semantic integration
repoq full ./my-project --format jsonld > quality.jsonld
```

=== "pip"
    ```bash
    pip install repoq[full]
    ```

=== "Development"
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kirill-0440/repoq.git
    cd repoq
    pip install -e ".[full,dev]"
    ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze repository structure with ontological intelligence
repoq structure /path/to/repo --output analysis.json

# Comprehensive analysis (structure + history + ontologies)
repoq full /path/to/repo --format jsonld --output comprehensive.jsonld

# Self-application (meta-quality loop)
repoq structure . --self-analysis --ontological
```

- **RDF/Turtle**: Linked data format for SPARQL queries
- **Markdown**: Human-readable reports with visualizations
- **Graphviz**: Dependency and architecture diagrams

## üß† Ontological Meta-Loop in Action

!!! ontology "Revolutionary Capability"
    RepoQ can analyze its own architecture through formal ontologies:
    
    ```python
    # RepoQ understanding itself
    concepts = ontology_manager.analyze_project_structure(repoq_project)
    
    # Extracted semantic concepts
    {
      "code:Class": ["StructureAnalyzer", "OntologyManager"],
      "c4:Component": ["Structure Analysis", "Ontology Intelligence"],
      "ddd:DomainService": ["Quality Analysis Service"],
      "cross_mappings": [
        "code:StructureAnalyzer ‚Üí c4:StructureComponent",
        "ddd:QualityService ‚Üí c4:QualityComponent"
      ]
    }
    ```

This creates unprecedented insight into software architecture and establishes the foundation for AI-assisted software development.
